          <p style="text-align:left;">Self-defense (self-defence in some varieties of English) is a countermeasure that
            involves
            defending the health and well-being of oneself from harm.
            The use of the right of self-defense as a legal justification for the use of force in times
            of danger is available in many jurisdictions.Physical self-defense is the use of physical force to
            counter an immediate threat of violence. Such force can be either armed or unarmed. In either
            case, the chances of success depend on various parameters,
            related to the severity of the threat on one hand, but also on the mental and physical preparedness of the
            defender.</p>

              <h2>Lesson-1</h2>
              <h3 style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Objective:</b>Hammer Strike & Groin Kick</h3>
              <p>
              <h3><u>Hammer Strike</u></h3>
              The hammer fist (or hammer strike) is wildly popular with
              beginning Krav Maga training. Its versatility and ease of deployment make it a favorite among new self
              defense enthusiasts.</p>
              <p>
                The Hammer Fist is a short-ranged combative technique that involves a very natural,
                primate movement. The fist is brought down and out, like a hammer. Contact is made with the
                fleshy part of the bottom of the fist. Your feet, hips, core, and shoulders drive the strike,
                with your body weight pulling the strike through and back. You’ll most likely deliver this either
                on the vertical or horizontal plane, but you can also strike at various angles.

                It's fast. It's powerful. And while it all happens in a blur, there are 3 distinct steps that need to
                happen
                for effective delivery of the hammer fist.
              </p>
              <h3><u>Groin Kick</u></h3>
              <p>
                groin attack is a deliberate strike to the groin area of one's opponent.
                The technique can be quickly debilitating due to the sensitivity of the groin area
                and genitalia, and is sometimes used as a self-defense technique.
                The technique is often banned in sports. Groin attacks have been popularized as a comedic device in
                various forms of media.</p>
              <p>Groin attacks are sometimes used as a self-defense technique. The attack can allow a combatant
                to temporarily disable an assailant, making it easy for them to escape. When an opponent is at close
                range,
                a knee strike to the groin is easy to execute and difficult to defend against. It is often, but not
                always, effective.

                Some martial arts include instruction in kappo, healing techniques to recover from incapacitating
                attacks including groin attacks.

              <h2>Lesson-2</h2>
              <h3 style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Objective:</b>Elbow Strike & Escape Bear Hug Attack</h3>
              <p>
              <h3><u>ELBOW STRIKE</u></h3>
              An elbow strike (commonly referred to as simply an "elbow") is a strike with the point of the elbow,
              the part of the forearm nearest to the elbow, or the part of the upper arm nearest to the elbow.
              Elbows can be thrown sideways similarly to a hook, upwards similarly to an uppercut, downwards with the
              point of the elbow, diagonally or in direct movement and in several other ways, like during a jump. Elbow
              strikes are native to the traditional Southeast Asian martial arts, traditional Chinese martial arts and
              traditional Okinawan martial arts.

              </p>
              <h3><u>ESCAPE BEAR HUG ATTACK</u></h3>
              The bear hug technique is extremely dangerous simply because it’s so widely used by attackers everywhere.

              <p>
                It assumes they grab you from behind when you least expect it,
                with minimal chance of you seeing them. This gives your attacker the element of surprise.
